Hello, my name is Hongxi Li. I am pursuing my Master’s degree in the Media Computing and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (MCISLab) at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Xinxiao Wu](https://wuxinxiao.github.io/). My research interests include visual understanding, video summarization, and any projects involving deep learning or pre-trained models.
